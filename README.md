## This repo holds ideas that pop-up once in while on my little brain in the hope that someday they will be explained on a youtube video or blog post.

### Angular
- view-child-services - you can use @ViewChildren/@ViewChild to access services injected on child components.

### TypeScript
- infer.ts - use the 'infer' keyword to infer the return type of an overloaded function.
- getTypeFromIndexSignature.ts - get type of index signature
